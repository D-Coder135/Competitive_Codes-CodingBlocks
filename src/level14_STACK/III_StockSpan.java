/**
 * CODING BLOCKS QUESTION =>
 * <p>
 * The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of N daily price quotes for a stock, and
 * we need to calculate span of stockâ€™s price for all N days. You are given an array of length N, where ith element
 * of array denotes the price of a stock on ith. Find the span of stock's price on ith day, for every 1<=i<=N.
 * A span of a stock's price on a given day, i, is the maximum number of consecutive days before the (i+1)th day,
 * for which stock's price on these days is less than or equal to that on the ith day.
 * <p>
 * Sample Input
 * 5
 * 30
 * 35
 * 40
 * 38
 * 35
 * <p>
 * Sample Output
 * 1 2 3 1 1 END
