/**
 * LEETCODE QUESTION 1458 =>
 * <p>
 * Given two arrays nums1 and nums2.
 * <p>
 * Return the maximum dot product between non-empty subsequences of nums1 and nums2 with the same length.
 * <p>
 * A subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none)
 * of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
 * (i.e, [2,3,5] is a subsequence of [1,2,3,4,5] while [1,5,3] is not).
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums1 = [2,1,-2,5], nums2 = [3,0,-6]
 * <p>
 * Output: 18
 * <p>
 * Explanation: Take subsequence [2,-2] from nums1 and subsequence [3,-6] from nums2.
 * Their dot product is (2*3 + (-2)*(-6)) = 18.
