/**
 * LEETCODE QUESTION 931 =>
 * <p>
 * Given an n x n array of integers matrix, return the minimum sum of any falling path through matrix.
 * <p>
 * A falling path starts at any element in the first row and chooses the element in the next row that is either
 * directly below or diagonally left/right. Specifically, the next element from position (row, col) will be
 * (row + 1, col - 1), (row + 1, col), or (row + 1, col + 1).
 * <p>
 * Input: matrix = [[2,1,3],[6,5,4],[7,8,9]]
 * Output: 13
 * Explanation: There are two falling paths with a minimum sum as shown.
