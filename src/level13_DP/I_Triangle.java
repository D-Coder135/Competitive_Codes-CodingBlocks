/**
 * LEETCODE QUESTION 120 =>
 * <p>
 * Given a triangle array, return the minimum path sum from top to bottom.
 * <p>
 * For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally,
 * if you are on index i on the current row, you may move to either index i or index i + 1 on the next row.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]
 * Output: 11
 * Explanation: The triangle looks like:
 * 2
 * 3 4
 * 6 5 7
 * 4 1 8 3
 * The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11 (underlined above).
