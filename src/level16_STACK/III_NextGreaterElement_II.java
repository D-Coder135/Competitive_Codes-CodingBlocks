/**
 * CODING BLOCKS QUESTION & LEETCODE QUESTION 503 =>
 * <p>
 * Given a circular integer array nums (i.e., the next element of nums[nums.length - 1] is nums[0]), return the next
 * greater number for every element in nums.
 * <p>
 * The next greater number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array,
 * which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return -1 for this
 * number.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [1,2,1]
 * Output: [2,-1,2]
 * Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2;
 * The number 2 can't find next greater number.
 * The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
